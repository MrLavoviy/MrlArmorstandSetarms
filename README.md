# MrlArmorstandSetarms
This mod helps you to set arms to armorstands in minecraft in survival mode.

Try to write:

/setarms (true/false)

  if you wrote "true",
  
   nearest armorstand in 5 blocks will have arms.
    
  if you wrote "false",
  
   nearest armorstand in 5 block will not have arms.
    
It's working in survival mode.

(I think it's not cheating, it's just beautiful for

decorations and available in survival mode now)
